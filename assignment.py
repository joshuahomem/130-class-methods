Tic Tac Toe
Create a tic tac toe game that is enclosed entirely within a function.  The basic shell has been created, as well as the main block that will be used to execute the class method that runs the game.
You need to create the methods and class variables that you will use.

One idea would be to create a board like so:

1 | 2 | 3
---------
4 | 5 | 6
---------
7 | 8 | 9

or you could also use the keypad to help choose positions:

7 | 8 | 9
---------
4 | 5 | 6
---------
1 | 2 | 3

To enhance your display, you can access unicode symbols
